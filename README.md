# loan_status_ml

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected using Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN).  

## Overview  
We applied Logistic Regression and K-NN to analyze loan approval patterns and compare their performance.  

## How to Use  
Run the notebook to:  
- Load and explore the dataset  
- Train Logistic Regression and K-NN models  
- Evaluate performance  

## Libraries Used  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

This project provides insights into loan approval prediction using machine learning.
